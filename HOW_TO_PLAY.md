# How to Play Orbital Defense

## Launching the Game
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. The game loads immediately with no additional downloads.
2. From the start screen choose **Start Game** to begin or **Leaderboard** to view the top scores. If you have a previous save you can also choose **Load Game**.

## Basic Controls
- **Move Base:** Drag with the mouse or use the **WASD** or **Arrow** keys.
- **Fire:** The cannon automatically shoots when enemies are in range. Press **F** to toggle auto-fire or use the **Space** key when auto-fire is disabled.
- **Macross Missiles:** Press **M** to unleash a barrage of missiles once the upgrade is unlocked.
- **Game Speed:** Use the **«** and **»** buttons to adjust how fast the game runs. You can change the speed even while paused.
- **Upgrades:** Click the base to open the upgrade ring. You can also click directly on an upgrade icon within the ring for quick access.
- **Interface Toggles:**
  - **H** – show or hide the hotkeys list.
  - **I** – display detailed enemy statistics.
  - **O** – toggle ring upgrade information.
  - **Full Screen** and **Mute** buttons are available on the HUD.
  - **Music:** use the arrow buttons to cycle through tracks. The slider next
    to the selector controls volume, starting at 25%. Choose **Off** to disable
    the background music.

## Surviving Waves
Each wave spawns a group of enemies that approach from beyond your sensor range. The faint ring around your base shows the cannon's firing radius. Upgrade the **Sensors** category to detect enemies earlier. Destroy enemies to earn credits and purchase new abilities.

- Watch the timer as waves progress; bosses appear periodically and require extra firepower.
- Defeated enemies drop experience and credits used to buy upgrades such as improved cannon range, missile homing, and sensor enhancements.
- To send the next wave early, use the **Send Next Wave** button when available.

## Game Over and Leaderboard
When you are defeated the **Game Over** screen displays your final wave and time survived. Enter your initials to submit a score to the global leaderboard. Scores are ranked by wave and completion time. You can view the leaderboard from the start screen at any time.

Enjoy defending the orbit!
