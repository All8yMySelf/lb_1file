# Orbital Defence Elite

This repository contains a small browser game written entirely in a single HTML file. The goal of the challenge is to keep all the game's HTML, CSS and JavaScript code self-contained so that it can be played by simply opening `index.html`.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. The game will load immediately with no additional assets required. Use the on-screen instructions or the hotkeys listed on the start screen to play.

## About

`index.html` now embeds the original `styles.css` and `themes.js` directly inside `<style>` and `<script>` tags. There are no external dependencies besides the Phaser library pulled from a CDN.

The previous `css/` and `js/` folders have been removed as part of the single-file challenge.
